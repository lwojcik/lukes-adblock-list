# Luke's AdBlock list

This is a personal blacklist for uBlock Origin installations on devices I use. I keep it here so that I can manage it easily from a single place.

The list URL: https://raw.githubusercontent.com/lwojcik/lukes-adblock-list/master/hosts.txt

The list can be used with AdBlock, uBlock Origin and other compatible ad-blocking extensions.

I spent time to tailor the list to the way I use my computing devices. If you feel like using it, please bear in mind it's very heavily opinionated. I may deliberately block well-known sites for my own reasons. You may or may not agree with my choices.
