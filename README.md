# Luke's AdBlock List

This is my personal blacklist for uBlock Origin instances. I keep it here so that I can manage it easily from a single place.

The list URL: https://adblock.lukem.net/hosts.txt

The list can be used with AdBlock, uBlock Origin and other compatible ad-blocking extensions.

I spent time to tailor the list to the way I use my computing devices. Before using it please bear in mind this list is very heavily opinionated. I may deliberately block well-known sites for my own reasons. You may or may not agree with my choices.
